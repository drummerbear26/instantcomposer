This is where the readme info for the Instant Composer: Mad-libbed Music will go...

Instantly write compositions at a computer kiosk (or from your phone) for an ensemble of improvising musicians. Each unique score is made up of phrases of text that explain what the musicians will play. It is put into a queue and played as if selected from a jukebox and then projected for the musicians to read. A projected timer signals when the piece begins and ends. Volunteers guide and provide instructions on how to write scores at the kiosk or using a smart phone. Finally, a projected spectral analysis visualization will enhance the projected score.

This project is produced by artist John Keston in collaboration with Art Institutes International Minnesota students, local improvising musicians, and the Northern Spark 2015 audience.
